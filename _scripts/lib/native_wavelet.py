"""Native wavelet producer (successor to the Stage 2.3 multiscale proxy): PyWavelets DWT on past-only windows.

For every bar t with a complete trailing window [t-W+1, t] of finite inputs, `pywt.wavedec` is applied to that
window alone, and the right-edge (most recent) coefficient of each band is emitted at t, together with the mean
squared detail coefficient per level (band energy). Nothing after t is read, the window is a declared parameter
frozen from TRAIN (never derived from the input length), every bar is evaluated (cadence 1, feature age 0), and
missing inputs make the window's outputs NaN instead of being interpolated. Because each value is a function of
its own window only, prefixes, restarts and chunked replays (with W-1 rows of overlap) emit identical values.

Method identity: method_id NATIVE, method_name DWT_DB4_TRAILING_WINDOW (for wavelet='db4'). The Stage 2.3
`compute_wavelet` remains PROXY (rolling means 16/32/64/128) and is not edited.
